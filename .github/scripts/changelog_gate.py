"""Fail a pull request that changes public surface without recording it.

Four of the six fix commits audited in #368 changed user-visible behaviour and
recorded nothing: a new cargo feature, two new public API items, a new load
error class, a removed importable module. Nothing enforced it, so it depended
on whoever wrote the PR remembering. This is the enforcement.

Scope. Only files that ship, or that describe what ships:

  * ``turbovec/src/**.rs``                      the Rust crate's surface
  * ``turbovec-python/src/**.rs``               the binding crate
  * ``turbovec-python/python/turbovec/**.py``   the shipped Python package,
    including the four framework integrations
  * ``turbovec/Cargo.toml``, ``turbovec-python/Cargo.toml``,
    ``turbovec-python/pyproject.toml`` — features, MSRV, ``requires-python``,
    extras and dependency floors are all user-visible packaging surface, and
    "a new cargo feature" was one of the four misses this gate exists for.
  * ``turbovec-go/src/**.rs``, ``turbovec-go/Cargo.toml``, and the public
    Go wrappers (``index.go``, ``idmap.go``, ``conv.go``, ``results.go``,
    ``warning.go``). Generated UniFFI scaffolding under
    ``internal/uniffi/`` is not gated.

Within those it ignores two kinds of change:

  * comments and blank lines, so documenting a function is not an excuse to
    invent a changelog entry;
  * anything inside a ``#[cfg(test)]`` region, so landing a regression test
    beside a fix — exactly the workflow #367 wants — is not taxed.

And it requires the changelog to have actually gained something: an added,
non-blank line under ``## [Unreleased]``. Touching the file is not enough.

Escape hatch, for changes that genuinely are not user-visible:

  * add the ``skip-changelog`` label to the PR, or
  * put ``[skip changelog]`` **alone on its own line** in the PR body.

The line must be exactly the marker, and must not be inside a code block. A
body that merely mentions the marker in prose — quoting CONTRIBUTING.md, or a
note saying the hatch was deliberately *not* used, or showing it in a fenced
block — does not disarm the gate. The first version of this script used a
substring test and silently disabled itself on the very PR that introduced it.
The predicate is shared with the mutation gate; see ``escape_hatch.py``.

Usage:
    changelog_gate.py --base <sha-or-ref> --head <sha-or-ref>

Reads PR_BODY and PR_LABELS (newline- or comma-separated) from the
environment; both are optional so the script runs against any two commits.

    """Remove comments, strings and char literals, keeping line numbering.

    Brace depth is what delimits a `#[cfg(test)]` item, and a brace inside a
    comment or a string is not a brace. Counting them raw is not merely
    imprecise, it is unsound in the dangerous direction: an *extra* `{` inflates
    the depth, and the surplus `}` that eventually balances it is borrowed from
    the enclosing block, so the region closes LATE and swallows shipped code
    that follows it (#395).

    Handled: line comments, nested block comments (Rust's do nest), strings and
    byte/C strings, raw strings of any hash count, char literals and lifetimes.
    Exactly three of those can span lines — block comments, strings and raw
    strings — and they are exactly the three states `kind` has. That state is
    carried across lines, so the scan must start at the top of the file rather
    than at the attribute, or it can begin inside one of the three and read its
    contents as code. The rest are line-local by construction: a line comment
    ends at the newline, and the `'` branch resolves within the line either way
    — a char literal is matched whole, a lone lifetime tick is stepped over. Do
    not "fix" that by giving them state too: an unpaired tick would then run to
    the next tick some lines below, and the `}` deleted in between makes the
    region close LATE over shipped code, which is the miscount above.

    Literal spans are deleted, not padded, so line numbering survives but
    column positions do not: code following a literal on the same line shifts
    left by the literal's width, and a line that begins inside a multi-line
    literal loses its leading indentation with it. Nothing downstream reads a
    column offset — only brace counts, an anchored prefix match, a line's last
    character and line indices — so pad the spans if that ever stops holding.
